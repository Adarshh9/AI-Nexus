# AI Nexus

AI Nexus is a web-based application that recommends AI/ML models and datasets based on user requirements. By leveraging data scraped from Hugging Face, the application filters and suggests models and datasets that best match the userâ€™s needs.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides tailored model/dataset suggestions based on specific user input.
- **Detailed Metadata:** Displays comprehensive model/dataset information including downloads, author, creation date, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web interface for easy input and viewing of recommendations.
- **Direct Links:** Facilitates direct access to recommended models/datasets on Hugging Face.
- **Extensive Filtering:** Ensures high-quality recommendations by sorting based on downloads and other criteria.

## Data Collection

The data for the models is collected using web scraping with Beautiful Soup from Hugging Face. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the dataset to understand model/dataset specifications and distributions.

## Recommendation System

The recommendation system uses cosine similarity to match user requirements with model/dataset specifications. The top 10 models/datasets are suggested based on the similarity score and filtered by downloads in descending order.

## Challenges Addressed

1.**Model Overload**: Filters and recommends models/datasets based on user input, reducing the overwhelming number of choices.

2.**Time-Consuming Research**: Automates the process of gathering and comparing model specifications.

3.**Inconsistent Model Information**: Consolidates metadata in one place, providing a uniform view.

4.**Lack of Model Comparison Tools**: Includes a comparison feature to help developers make informed decisions.


## Benefits for Developers

1.**Enhanced Productivity**: Automates the recommendation and comparison process, allowing developers to focus on building.
   
2.**Centralized Information**: Reduces the need to visit multiple sites to gather information.

3.**Educational Tool**: Exposes developers to a variety of models and applications.

4.**Scalable and Adaptable**: Easily updated with new models and datasets.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Adarshh9/AI-Nexus.git
    cd AI-Nexus
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    conda create --name ainexus python=3.12
    conda activate ainexus
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the `vector_db.pickle` file for model recommendation:**
    - Download the `vector_db.pickle` file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZBlk3g-x50AUOff4gXqJ4oR21RMyE0cM/view?usp=sharing) and place it in the 'data/model' directory of the project.

5. **Download the `vector_db_pickle` file for dataset recommendation:**
    - Download the `vector_db_pickle` file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TIRjsoozX-8Y104HoagA-dNZ37K1p7UM/view?usp=sharing) ,rename it and place it in the 'data/dataset' directory of the project.
      
## Usage

1. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Access the application in your browser:**
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

3. **Provide your requirements** by selecting the following fields:
- For Model Match:
   - **Task Type**, **Task**, **Model Type**, **Framework**
- For Dataset Match:
   - **Dataset Description**
  Click "Get Recommendations" to view the suggested models.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main application script using Flask.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for loading data and recommending models/datasets.
- `templates/*.html`: HTML template, CSS styles, JavaScript for handling form submission and displaying recommendations for the web interface.
- `vector_db.pickle`: The vector database file needed for recommendations (download from Google Drive).

## Example
